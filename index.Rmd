# Installation

You can choose among different versions of `drake`.

```r
# Install the latest stable release from CRAN.
install.packages("drake")

# Alternatively, install the development version from GitHub.
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("ropensci/drake")
```

- You must properly install `drake` using `install.packages()`, `devtools::install_github()`, or similar. It is not enough to use `devtools::load_all()`, particularly for the parallel computing functionality, in which multiple R sessions initialize and then try to `require(drake)`.
- For `make(parallelism = "Makefile")`, Windows users may need to download and install [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
- To use `make(parallelism = "future")` or `make(parallelism = "future_lapply")` to deploy your work to a computing cluster (see the [high-performance computing guide](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/hpc.html)), you will need the [`future.batchtools`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.batchtools) package.
